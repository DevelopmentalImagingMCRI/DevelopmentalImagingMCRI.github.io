The Developmental Imaging Group at the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute
works with MRI, CT and ultrasound imaging data for research studies.

Software we release for processing such data is available from this site:
<p>
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="https://github.com/DevelopmentalImagingMCRI/M-CRIB_atlas"> Melbourne Children's Regional Infant Brain (M-CRIB) atlas</a>.
<li> <a href="http://DevelopmentalImagingMCRI.github.io/mantis">MANTiS: Morphologically adaptive neonate tissue segmentation.</a> An SPM toolbox for tissue classification in T2 weighted MRI scans for neonates.
<li> <a href="http://DevelopmentalImagingMCRI.github.io/dwimotioncorrect">DWIMotionCorrect.</a> A modified eddy/motion correction tool which reduces registration bias at b=3000.
<li> <a href="http://DevelopmentalImagingMCRI.github.io/freesurfer_statsurf_display">freesurfer_statsurf_display.</a> A set of tools for MATLAB that plots Freesurfer surfaces with each region of a selected cortical parcellation coloured according to p-value/effect size/arbitrary values/freesurfer colours/r squared.
<li> <a href="http://github.com/richardbeare/mbwss"> Marker-based
    watershed scalper.</a> A fast and robust data driven brain
    extraction tool for T1 weighted images based on the morphological
    watershed transform. Versions for human and macaque scans are
    included.
 <li> <a
    href="http://github.com/DevelopmentalImagingMCRI/supervisedNPE">
    Supervised neighbourhood preserving embedding</a> for detecting
    patterns of variation in MRI scans. Code supporting <a
    href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/11/126441">Ball
    et al</a>.
