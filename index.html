  <ul>
    <li> <a href="https://github.com/DevelopmentalImagingMCRI/M-CRIB_atlas"> Melbourne Children's Regional Infant Brain (M-CRIB) atlas</a>.
<li> <a href="http://DevelopmentalImagingMCRI.github.io/mantis">MANTiS: Morphologically adaptive neonate tissue segmentation.</a> An SPM toolbox for tissue classification in T2 weighted MRI scans for neonates.
<li> <a href="http://DevelopmentalImagingMCRI.github.io/dwimotioncorrect">DWIMotionCorrect.</a> A modified eddy/motion correction tool which reduces registration bias at b=3000.
<li> <a href="http://github.com/richardbeare/mbwss"> Marker-based watershed scalper.</a> A fast and robust data driven brain extraction tool for T1 weighted images based on the morphological watershed transform. Versions for human and macaque scans are included.
